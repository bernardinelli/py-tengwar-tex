# py-tengwar-tex
A short Python 3 script to convert Quenya text in Latin alphabet to Tengwar commands to be used with the [TengwarScript LaTeX](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/tengwarscript) package.

**Usage**: save a file with the Quenya text and run the script with your favourite interpreter.  You can also do it manually by importing this module and using the functions. The tengwar_roman_to_tex does the replacing. 

**Note**: I am not actively maintaining this repository, but now a fork with recent updates exist: https://github.com/BardenB/py-tengwar-tex
